### Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```ruby
bundle install --without production
```

Next, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```ruby
rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```ruby
rails server
```
